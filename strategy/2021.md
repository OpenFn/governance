# High-level strategy and roadmaps for the implementation toolkit

April, 2021

## Strategy

Sustainability underpins our strategy. We've built a stable revenue base at Open
Function Group (OFG) and we've ensured that OFG is _dependent_ on several key
parts of the integration toolkit (docs, engine, core, adaptors, devtools). This
dependency further ensures that OFG will continue to invest heavily in those
tools and the broader community will benefit.

We see microservice (which uses engine, core, and adaptors in almost the same
way that platform does) as the flagship FOSS product in the integration toolkit,
and we see it growing primarily via implementations. Its roadmap should be
determined by the requirements of governments/NGOs who are transitioning
from platform to microservice and it will be funded by those users and external
grants.

In order to add new or prioritize existing features to the roadmap, we'll rely
heavily on the actual requirements of these implementation opportunities to
ensure adoption.

The feature roadmap spans multiple products (see below), and we've identified
that if microservice is used in conjunction with platform, the most important
"new features" may actually be additions to
[docs.openfn.org](https://docs.openfn.org). Expanded docs are necessary to help
more organizations and individuals (outside of OFG) understand and access OFG's
implementation process. We aim to guide them through a fairly comprehensive
"self-service" experience with both the platform and the toolkit to enable the
growth of local private or within-government integration teams that can provide
implementation services and support for these integration projects outside of
OFG.

The relationship between integration toolkit and platform will be such that both
share a fundamental "project configuration" which allows a user of platform to
transition to "microservice" at any time, or vice-versa. (See image 1.)

This will enable governments and NGOs to maintain full-featured sandbox
implementations of OpenFn on the platform, allow for easier design,
configuration, prototyping, testing, and change management, and then "deploy"
version of this project as microservices to run on local servers using
production data. (See image 2.)

We see this combination of the integration toolkit (which is fully FOSS) and
platform (which can run in the cloud or deployed on local servers, but requires
a paid license) as providing the right balance between ease-of-use and local
ownership while ensuring sustainability.

## Key Implementations

### SwissTPH

Now: CommCare/dhis2 on OpenFn/core; later: migration to OpenFn/microservice?

Came through the OpenHIE community, provided the first external pull request to
OpenFn’s "core"

### Thailand MOPH

Now: integrate health data with Primero case data; later: integrate other agency
data

### Trinidad & Tobago government interagency work

Now: Primero connecting with Police, Social Services, MoE

### MoH Ghana

Now: ODK & VaccinneUPP to dhis2, maybe fine with platform?

### Cambodia Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY)

Now: case referrals between ministry/NGOs/agencies, maybe fine with platform?

### Zambia NPHI

### Ethiopia MoH/JSI

## Product Roadmaps

### [docs](https://docs.openfn.org)

- Walk-through video for exporting projects from platform to run as microservice

### microservice

- ~~Log service~~ ✓
- ~~Enhanced documentation~~ ✓
- Error notifications service (not catch jobs)
- Web UI
  - Users
  - View/export logs
  - Run jobs on demand
- Persistence
  - Retryable messages
  - Save runs to a database
- Inbox security (not network security)

### engine

See https://github.com/OpenFn/engine/issues

### core

See https://github.com/OpenFn/core/issues

### devtools

- Cleaner process for releasing adaptors to NPM

### adaptors

- UNHCR Progres
- Twillio
